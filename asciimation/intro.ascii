  Original Work   : Simon Jansen ( http://www.asciimation.co.nz/ ) 
  SSHification    : Tai Groot ( tai@taigrr.com ) 
  Source Code     : https://github.com/taigrr/ssh-wars

  The hard work was done by Simon. This ssh app was inspired by 
  (but wholly reimplemented without reference to code from)
  what you get when you telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl

  Enjoy :)
